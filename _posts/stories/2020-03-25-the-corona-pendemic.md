I won't talk much about corona pandemic since everyone is talking about it.

Most of the cities if not countries are locked down. In India alone **1.3 billion** people are locked down. Whether you are student, working professional or just a normal person, you must be at home. If we talk about India, there is **21 days total lockdown** in the whole courntry.

Human is a social animal. some people find it difficult to stay in home qurantine.
During home qurantine, it depends on us how we utilize or waste this timespan.
Here I'll tell you 11 productive things you can do in your free time in qurantine. You can pick things based on your interest.

Remember, the best thing you can do to beat this virus is to do social distancing and staying at home.

_**This war can be fought by staying at home**_
