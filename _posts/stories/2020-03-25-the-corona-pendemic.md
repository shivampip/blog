I won't talk much about the corona pandemic since everyone is talking about it.

Most of the cities if not countries are locked down. In India alone **1.3 billion** people are locked down. Whether you are a student, working professional or just a normal person, you must be at home. If we talk about India, there is **21 days total lockdown** in the whole country.

I'll tell you 11 productive and fun things you can do in your free time in quarantine. You can pick things based on your interests.


## Let's Start

### Give a chance to your hidden photographer

You have this high-end camera in your hand. Yes, I'm talking about your smartphone. remember, you always wanted to click some awesome shots. but due to busy schedules, you couldn't give it much time.

### Put your thoughts on canvas

Okay, that line was quite filmy. I know it's difficult to draw with imagination. but you can draw a replica of something. you might use to draw when you were a child but in fast running life, you almost left it. but now you are free. Time to revive it.

### Take an online class

You can master any non-physical learnable skill sitting at your room. All you need is a laptop/mobile and internet connection.


There are so many online courses available (free and paid) that start from zero and by the end make you a hero in that skill. Take a course that interests you. you can even learn some mysterious skills like [Lucid Dreaming](https://www.udemy.com/topic/lucid-dreaming/){:target="_blank"}

### Write a short story

Sit calm<br>
Close your eyes<br>
And build an imaginary world (that can be a small part of your previous memories as well)
Now imagine a character in your imaginary world.
You are God in this imaginary world. whatever you want will happen here.
Just write it down on a paper (paper/digital)

### Start a new habit

It takes 21 days to form a habit. Congratulations, you have the time. 
Decide a good habit like meditation, exercise, reading books, a healthy diet or any other good habit.

And start developing it day-by-day. 
by the time lockdown will end, you'll have a good new habit.

#### Note: 
* Some good habits are automatically building like cleaning hands, hygiene
* Some bad habits are automatically stopping like smoking etc due to home quarantine :)

### Record your first song

You are a bathroom singer. or you murmur a song or just music excites you. You always wanted to sing but you didn't have proper time to do it.

Now you have time as well as the audience (your family).
Record a song and share it on social media.
Let your circle know about the musician inside you.

If you feel you can't sing, learn to play one musical instrument.

### Spend time with family

Remember old times, when light used to cut or some other occasion, the whole family used to sit together and talk. but again it lost somewhere in your fast running lifestyle. 

But at this time, no matter what, you must be at home with your loved ones. This difficult time has brought you together with your family. 


I had written a [quora answer](https://www.quora.com/What-can-I-do-for-10-minutes-every-day-that-will-change-my-life/answer/Shivam-Agrawal-152?ch=10&share=6367450c&srid=ut1kf5){:target="_blank"} about power of spending time with loved ones.
Sit with family, have sips of tea. It will put a smile on everyone's face and will give you happy memories.

### At Last...

Remember, the best thing you can do to beat this virus is to do social distancing and staying at home.

>This war can be fought by staying at home
